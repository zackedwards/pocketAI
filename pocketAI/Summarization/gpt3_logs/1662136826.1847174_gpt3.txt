RESPONSE:

If a dispute arises between the parties, any arbitration proceedings will take place in San Francisco, California. The parties agree that any disputes must be brought against each other on an individual basis only, and that neither party can bring a dispute as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action. In an arbitration proceeding, an arbitrator cannot combine more than one person's or entity's disputes into a single case, and each party agrees that the arbitrator's decision or award in one person's or entity's case can only impact the person or entity that brought the dispute. If for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, each party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury. If a court decides that this section is not enforceable or valid, then this section will be null and void, but the rest of the terms will still apply. If a party is a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, trust, or other entity, that party will notify the other party in writing at least 30 days prior to consummating a transaction or series of transactions in which it buys, sells, shares, or transfers one or more API keys or other access to the services pursuant to a business combination, acquisition, merger, joint venture, partnership transaction, purchase or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of an entity, or liquidation event.
