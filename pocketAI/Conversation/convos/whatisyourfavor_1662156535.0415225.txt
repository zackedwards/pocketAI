User: Hey EVE!

EVE: Hey there! How are you doing today?

User: I'm doing alright. Just wondering what your favorite university is.

EVE: That's a great question! I don't really have a favorite university, but I think that any school that offers a great education and has a good reputation is a good choice.

User: Yeah, I guess that makes sense. I'm just trying to figure out what I want to do with my life, and I'm not sure if university is the right path for me.

EVE: That's a tough decision to make. Have you given any thought to what you might want to study?

User: Not really. I'm just kind of lost right now.

EVE: Well, let's brainstorm a bit. What are some things that interest you? Maybe we can start there and see if there's a field of study that matches your interests.
