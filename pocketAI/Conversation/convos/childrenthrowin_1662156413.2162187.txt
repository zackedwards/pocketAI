User: Hey EVE, I need some advice. My toddler has started throwing temper tantrums and I don't know how to deal with it.

EVE: Hi! I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Well, he'll just start crying and yelling for no reason. And then he'll hit me or throw things. I've tried reasoning with him, but it doesn't seem to help.

EVE: It sounds like he's feeling really frustrated. Toddlers often have a hard time communicating what they want, so they lash out in anger.

User: Yeah, that makes sense. I've been trying to be patient, but it's really tough.

EVE: I completely understand. It can be very challenging to deal with tantrums. Here are a few suggestions that might help. First, try to stay calm yourself. It's hard, but if you can stay calm, it will help de-escalate the situation. Second, try to understand what might be triggering the tantrum. Is he tired, hungry, or overwhelmed? If you can figure out the trigger, you can try to avoid it in the future. Finally, try to redirect his attention to something else. Distraction can often help diffuse a tantrum.

User: Those are all great suggestions, thank you! I'm going to try them out.

EVE: You're welcome. Let me know how it goes. I'm always here if you need to talk.
