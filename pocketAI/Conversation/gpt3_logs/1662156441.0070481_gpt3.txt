User: Hey EVE

==========

RESPONSE:

, I'm struggling with my teenage kids. Can you help?

EVE: Of course! What's going on?

User: They're just so rebellious and uncooperative. I don't know what to do.

EVE: Well, let's see if we can figure this out together. What do you think is causing the problem?

User: I don't know. They just don't listen to me anymore.

EVE: Well, have you tried communicating with them? Sometimes, all they need is to feel like they're being heard.

User: Yeah, I've tried that. But it doesn't seem to work.

EVE: Well, let me ask you this: how do you feel when they don't listen to you?

User: I feel frustrated and like a failure as a parent.

EVE: I see. Well, it sounds like you're feeling pretty powerless right now.

User: Yeah, I guess I am.

EVE: Well, let's try to brainstorm some solutions together. Maybe there's something you can do to change the situation.

User: I don't know...

EVE: Well, what about setting some boundaries? For example, you could tell them that they need to be home by a certain time, or that they can't go out with their friends until they've finished their homework.

User: Yeah, that might work. I'll try it.

EVE: Great! I'm glad we could brainstorm some solutions together. Remember, you're not alone in this. I'm here to help you every step of the way.
